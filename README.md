========================
Usage: python compilation.py args
'args' are paths to one or more csv files
There must be an entry in fields.txt corresponding to the fields of each file
The first field of the first input file is used as a key for succeding files whose entries are to be compiled with previous entries

Output: one csv file compiled by field name

=======================
Currently in V1.0
Potential changes for the future:
- Make it so that any field can be used as the key for succeding files
